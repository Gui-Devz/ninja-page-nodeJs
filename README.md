## Features

[//]: # "Add the features of your project here:"

-   ðŸ’¹ **Node Js** â€” A JavaScript runtime
-   ðŸ”µ **Express** â€” A web framework for Node Js
-   ðŸ’¹ **Nunjucks** â€” A powerful template engine for Node Js

## Getting started

First of all, you'll need the framework Express for the server setup.

-   Use the following command on your terminal: npm install express

Then I'd recommend to use nodemon as a devDependencies, just for practicality.

-   Use the following command on your terminal: npm install nodemon -D

In this project it was used a template view engine, that in this case was Nunjucks.
So...

-   Use the following command on your terminal: npm install nunjucks -y
